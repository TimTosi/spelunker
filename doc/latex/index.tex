\subsection*{Purposes }

Spelunker is a software written in Python whose main purpose is to help to build other Bitcoin oriented tools. Spelunker offers several capabilities from parsing to user tracking.

\subsection*{Requirements }

In order to assure a correct execution, here is a list of the program requirements\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Database Postgre\+S\+Q\+L version 9.\+4.\+4
\item Python module psycopg2 version 2.\+6
\item Python version 2.\+7
\item Django version 1.\+7.\+6
\item Little endian system
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Installation }

In order to parse the blockchain, spelunker needs the .dat files that a bitcoin client software will download. After having downloaded blockchain file and installed all requirements, you have to create a new database. You do not need to create any table as the program will do it for you.

The last setup part is the configuration of the config.\+ini file. In this file, you have to provide several information such as the database name, the database username, the password related to the database user. You also have to set up the path to the directory containing all bitcoin block files previously downloaded. You will find this file in the spelunker/src directory. If no password is required for the database access, leave it blank.

Change your current directory for spelunker/src and can now lauch the blockchain parsing by typing the following command\+: ./main.py

\subsection*{Website Interface }

If you want to run the website in order to explore the blockchain in a more comfortable way, change your current directory for spelunker/website/spelunker\+Web and enter the following command\+: ./manage.py runserver 0.\+0.\+0.\+0\+:8080

You will now be able to access the website from localhost.
